Dense in Dense Network with Attention Module (DiDNT) for Blind Image Denoising
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a notebook about my latest research which was motivated by NVIDIA's (`research <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10277>`_) about self-supervised denoising. In this notebook, I only showed the inference process of my proposed network, Dense in Dense Network with Attention Module (DiDNT) for blind image denoising.

My proposed network utilized dense connectivity inside a very deep network structure, equipped with attention module to highlight channel importance.
